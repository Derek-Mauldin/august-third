Personal Website for Bootcamp

##PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice job on Milestone 1. Your code looks good, your project is set up correctly, and your purpose is defined. Your PWP passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

##Milestone 2 Feedback
Excellent work, all requirements are clearly stated and well thought out. Your Milestone 2 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

###Suggestions &amp; Edits
The only code error I see is a missing closing &lt;/html&gt; tag. I feel like a terrible micromanager for even mentioning something so minor. Otherwise everything looks awesome.

## Milestone 3 Feeback
Great job here, your Milestone 3 passes at Tier IV. Go ahead and begin development on Your PWP. 

Here are a coule of resources that may be helpful for your nav layout:

- [Bootstrap's off canvas example](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/offcanvas/)
- [Jasny Bootstrap's off-canvas menu](http://www.jasny.net/bootstrap/components/#navmenu-offcanvas)

## Milestone 4 Feedback
Thanks for submitting Milestone 4 on time Derek. It looks like you have a good start, but it will require some very focused work to get something presentable together by Thursday. 

The navigation you have is not mobile friendly. An easy way around this problem would be to use the Bootstrap default navbar. You can even implement this to be visible on xs screens only, and keep the navigation you currently have for all other screens. Look at [Bootstrap's responsive utilities](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities) 

### Suggestions
- To center the text in your header, try adding the Bootstrap class .text-center to the container.
- If you wanted to use the side bar navgation links to link to specified sections of your main content on the home page (essentially a single-page layout), you could either: 
  - Use jQuery/JavaScript to show/hide divs on click
  - Use a series of anchor tags in your content. The top nav in index.php on Karma has this implemented.

At this point, I suggest a simpler approach for sake of time. You still have a lot of work ahead of you, and I also suggest keeping styling simple - limit it to colors. You may just want to consider housing your content on different pages.
