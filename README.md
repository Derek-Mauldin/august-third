##PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice job on Milestone 1. Your code looks good, your project is set up correctly, and your purpose is defined. Your PWP passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

##Milestone 2 Feedback
Excellent work, all requirements are clearly stated and well thought out. Your Milestone 2 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

###Suggestions &amp; Edits
The only code error I see is a missing closing &lt;/html&gt; tag. I feel like a terrible micromanager for even mentioning something so minor. Otherwise everything looks awesome.
